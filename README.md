Refactoring example by Martin Fowler.

## Summary
- Find the natural class for behavior, consider what it needs to know.
- Convert integer code (switch) to polymorphism:
	- Isolate the code to move
	- Work one child class, method at the time.
	- Duplicate parent code, then customize child, then customize parent.
- Be alert to missing objects
- Practice!
- Run tests after every change, fix and understand the error.
